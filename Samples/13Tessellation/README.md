# 13 Tessellation

This demo shows the process of varying tessellation levels of a model based on the distance to the camera. 

### TODO

- apply a displacement map to the fine-grained tessellated vertices using the direction of normal vectors. See https://www.geeks3d.com/20100804/test-opengl-4-tessellation-with-displacement-mapping/
- GPU Gems 2 book has advanced topic on the adaptive tessellation of subdivision surfaces
