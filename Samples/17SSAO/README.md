# 17SSAO

This demo shows a basic implementation of SSAO based purely on the depth buffer. The resulting SSAO framebuffer is improved by a multipass gaussian blur. 

- The occlusion factor for such a point: 
- This implementation operators purely on the depth buffer without any additional scene data
- SSAO is improved by multipass gaussian blur
